```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

Library packages:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
packages <- c("dataone", "datapack", "devtools", "dplyr", "DT", "EML", "ggplot2", "ggpmisc", "kableExtra", "leaflet", "readxl", "tidyr", "citr")

for (package in packages) {

## Code examples

```{r}
2+2
```

This code give result without insetting the code + extra information
`r sqrt(2)`

Basic table here, make sure to use tabs and have an extra, empty line between text and table. 

|   x |   y |   z |
|-----|-----|-----|
|   1 |   2 |   3 |
|   4 |   5 |   6 |


To make an interactive table in the knit file, set it up like this. 
```{r}
library(DT)
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
DT::datatable(mpg,caption="Milage")
```


To not include the table in the knit file, then change the echo and eval to FALSE
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
library(DT)
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
DT::datatable(mpg,caption="Milage")
```
